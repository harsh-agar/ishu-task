I'll start by analyzing the dataset to identify the key factors and criteria for selecting the best e-commerce sellers. Here’s the plan:

1.  **Load the Data**: Load the provided dataset into Tableau to examine the structure and contents.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Parsing**: Use Tableau and custom SQL to clean and parse the dataset:
    -   Extract product count from `sellerproductcount`.
    -   Parse positive rating percentage and count from `sellerratings`.
    -   Extract contact information from `sellerdetails`.
    -   Parse business addresses to identify the country of registration.
    -   Extract the number of ratings for the hero products.
3.  **Develop Selection Criteria**: Based on the cleaned data, develop criteria to identify the most promising sellers. Potential criteria include:
    -   High product count.
    -   High positive rating percentage and count.
    -   Location preference (e.g., prioritize sellers registered in the US).
    -   High number of ratings for hero products.
4.  **Visualize Insights**: Create a Tableau Dashboard to visualize these insights and help the Acquisitions team identify top sellers.

Let's begin by loading the dataset and examining its contents. I'll then use custom SQL within Tableau to clean and parse the necessary fields.

I'll first load the dataset and provide an initial analysis of its structure.

The dataset contains several key columns that need to be parsed and cleaned to develop the selection criteria. The next steps involve:

1.  **Extracting Product Count**: Parse `sellerproductcount` to extract the numeric product count.
2.  **Parsing Seller Ratings**: Extract the percentage and number of ratings from `sellerratings`.
3.  **Extracting Contact Information**: Parse `sellerdetails` to get phone numbers and email addresses.
4.  **Parsing Business Address**: Identify the country from `businessaddress`.
5.  **Hero Product Ratings**: Extract ratings for `Hero Product 1` and `Hero Product 2`.

I'll outline the SQL queries and the data parsing steps to clean this data in Tableau. The cleaned data will then be used to develop the selection criteria for identifying the most promising sellers.

### SQL Queries and Data Parsing Steps

1.  **Extract Product Count**:
  
    ```
    SELECT 
        *,
        CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(sellerproductcount, r'over (\d+(,\d+)*)|(\d+(,\d+)*)') AS INT) AS product_count
    FROM 
        your_table
    ```
2.  **Parse Seller Ratings**:
    
    ```
    SELECT 
        *,
        CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(sellerratings, r'(\d+)%') AS INT) AS positive_rating_percent,
        CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(sellerratings, r'\((\d+) ratings\)') AS INT) AS rating_count
    FROM 
        your_table` 
    ```
3.  **Extract Contact Information**:
    
    ```    
    SELECT 
        *,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(sellerdetails, r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+') AS email,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(sellerdetails, r'\+?\d[\d -]{8,12}\d') AS phone
    FROM 
        your_table` 
	```
    
4.  **Parse Business Address**:
    
	```
    SELECT 
        *,
        CASE
            WHEN businessaddress LIKE '%US%' THEN 'US'
            WHEN businessaddress LIKE '%DE%' THEN 'Germany'
            WHEN businessaddress LIKE '%CN%' THEN 'China'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END AS country
    FROM 
        your_table
	```
5.  **Hero Product Ratings**:
    
    ```    
    SELECT 
        *,
        CAST("Hero Product 1 #ratings" AS INT) AS hero_product_1_ratings,
        CAST("Hero Product 2 #ratings" AS INT) AS hero_product_2_ratings
    FROM 
        your_table
    ```

These queries will help clean and parse the dataset. I'll proceed to implement these steps in Tableau and create a dashboard for visualization.

### Next Steps

1.  Implement the SQL queries in Tableau to clean and parse the dataset.
2.  Create visualizations to highlight the most promising sellers based on the developed criteria.
3.  Design a Tableau Dashboard to present these insights.

I will now set up Tableau to process and visualize this data accordingly. Once done, I'll share the insights and the final dashboard structure. ​
